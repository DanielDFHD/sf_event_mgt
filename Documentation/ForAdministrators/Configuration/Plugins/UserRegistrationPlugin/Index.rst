Events and event-registration - FE user registrations
=====================================================

**NOTE:** Make sure,that you place the Plugin on a page with "Usergroup Access Rights" configured to only show
the plugin output for logged in users and/or users belonging to a user group. Anyway, the plugin will only output
content if there is an active FE user session.

Settings
~~~~~~~~

Nearly all important settings can be made through the plugin, which override the
settings made with TypoScript. All plugin settings can also be configured with TypoScript
(use :php:`plugin.tx_sfeventmgt.settings.` with the keys shown below).
