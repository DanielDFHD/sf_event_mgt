======================================================
Event management and registration - Multi Registration
======================================================

The TYPO3 extension sf_event_mgt_multireg is an additional extension
for sf_event_mgt, which allows for the simultaneous registration of multiple
individuals for an event. The extension also supports custom registration
fields for each event, making it possible to collect detailed participant
data. This extension builds upon the extensibility of sf_event_mgt and only
requires a bit of JavaScript to show or hide additional fields.

Features
--------

- Allows to add multiple individuals in the registration form
- Works with configured registration fields
- First individual is the main registrant who must confirm the registration
- Integrates smoothly with the sf_event_mgt extension
- Requires minimal JavaScript for showing or hiding fields (vanilla JS version included)

.. note::
   This extension uses xclass to extend the EventController and should
   therefore be the only extension in a TYPO3 project extending sf_event_mgt.
